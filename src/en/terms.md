*Logicdan Platform Usage Policy version 1.0.1*

In order to provide transparency regarding the interests and expectations of the Logicdan platform towards its users, this document describes the terms of use in easily understandable topics:

1. **Logicdan is free to play and free of intrusive ads**: Logicdan does not display intrusive ads such as banners, pop-ups, sponsored links, and others. Campaigns integrated into the puzzle-solving mechanics, if included, will be identified. The platform also does not require payments. Optional contributions, which reward users with bolts (<span class="bolt"></span>) as an incentive for this practice, do not directly affect the competitiveness mechanics. The same resources can also be acquired for free as a regular reward for progress in the ranked mode levels.

2. **Logicdan is free of behavioral manipulation**: The platform does not use engagement techniques considered abusive, such as rewards based on random rewards, whether through payments or not.

3. **Logicdan does not require registration and login**: Although registration is not mandatory, it is recommended to allow the persistence of progress on servers, as well as to unlock features exclusive to registered users.

4. **Logicdan does not require the registration of an email address**: When registering, you can choose not to provide an email address, waiving access to the password recovery mechanism in this case.

5. **Logicdan does not send email notifications or communications**: The platform will only send emails when requested for the recovery of a forgotten password.

6. **Logicdan does not retain or use information obtained through cookies**: The platform limits itself to keeping on its servers information related to registration, ranking position, session history, progress, rewards, and content submitted through the Logicdan system.

7. **Logicdan recommends the use of strong passwords**: In the implementation of the servers, security practices, including encryption and other techniques, have been adopted. Thus, user credentials are not recorded in a way that allows malicious agents to access the content of passwords in case of data leakage. It is recommended to prefer long and easily memorable passwords. A password like `GralhaAzulPlantouUmaAraucariaNoMeuCoração` is exponentially more difficult to decipher by fraudsters than a short text, even if composed of letters, numbers, and special characters, making it difficult to memorize, as in the following example: `S!2E$5T5*uUi@`. The use of password manager applications is recommended, and passwords already registered on other services should be avoided.

8. **Logicdan applies moderation to user-published content**: New challenges created and submitted by the community will be evaluated by moderators. If approved, they will be added to the official catalog of the ranked mode. Otherwise, they will remain available in creative mode unless they contain content considered offensive or inappropriate.

9. **Sharing challenge solutions**: The dissemination, by any means, of solutions to challenges higher than level 4, as well as their use for illegitimate progress, is prohibited. Challenges higher than level 4 shared will be deactivated, and the involved users may face bans.

10. **About payments and support**: The current version of Logicdan servers was developed to provide a smooth and error-free experience. However, like any system, it may present inconsistencies. When making a payment through the means of supporting the platform developers, consider your act primarily as assistance for server maintenance and cost coverage. In case of issues, report a bug through the link at the bottom of logicdan page, providing information for individual assessment. Note that, if you chose to register on the platform without providing your email, support options will be more limited.
